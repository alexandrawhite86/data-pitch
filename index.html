        <p> Lead: Food Prices in Brooklyn, NY for cheddar cheese, chicken breast, white bread,
          bacon, ground beef, milk, and potatoes were higher than the Average
          Consumer Price Index February 2021 Northeast price for each product. </p>

      <p> Nutgraph: Demand for organic food has risen in New York City, and many
      of the stores with the highest average prices sold organic or vegan products. </p>

      <p>Key Points:

      <ol>

        <li>
          Food Prices are higher on average than northeast regional prices, but over 1 million
          New York City residents are food insecure, according to Mayor de Blasio's office.
        </li>
        <li>
          The biggest reason for the high price of food in certain stores were organic products,
          specifically milk, cheese, and chicken.
        </li>
        <li>
          Big grocery stores like Key Food have more buying power and can afford to price food
          at lower prices.

        </li>
        </ol>
       </p>

       <p> Kicker: I plan to wrap up my piece by showcasing how even though the demand for organic food has driven
         up prices, many New York City leaders and food advocacy groups want more organic and natural foods in New York City.
