        <p> Lead: The pandemic has driven up food prices nationally, but food prices in Brooklyn,
          NY for cheddar cheese, chicken breast, white bread, bacon, ground beef, milk, and potatoes
          were higher than the Average Consumer Price Index February 2021 Northeast price
          for each product this month. </p>

      <p> Nutgraph:Smaller grocery stores frequently priced food at higher prices
        than Key Food, which is one of the biggest grocery chains in New York City.
        Key Food has more buying power than smaller grocery stores that cannot
        afford to buy as large quantities of food in bulk. Smaller grocery stores
        also prioritize selling organic, natural food in order to compete with
        larger grocery stores, which drives up prices. The high prices of food in
        New York City in proportion to the regional average is troubling because,
        according to the city of New York there were 1.2 million New Yorkers who
        were food insecure pre-pandemic.   . </p>

      <p>Key Points:

      <ol>

        <li>
           The biggest reason for the high price of food in certain stores were
           organic products, specifically for milk, cheese and chicken.
           There is a high demand for organic, natural food  in New York City.
           Small  grocery stores like Orange Tree in Williamsburg sell organic, natural
           products because these are the products that the neighborhood wants,
           said owner Ki Heon Kim.
        </li>
        <li>
          Big  grocery stores like Key Food have more buying power and can
          afford to price food at lower prices. In fact, Key Food just struck a
          $10 billion deal with United Natural Foods Inc., a natural and organic
          wholesale distributor that works with Whole Foods, to distribute food
          for Key Foods over the next ten years. Patrick Penfield, Professor of
          Supply Chain Management at Syracuse University told Good Morning America
          that supermarkets that food prices will continue to rise nationally until May.
          “The major factors impacting costs are demand, weather issues within
          the U.S. and food producers and supermarkets not offering substantial
          discounts to shoppers,” Penfield told Good Morning America.

        Shopping for affordable, healthy food isn’t easy, but the city government
        of New York is working to bring organic, healthy food at affordable prices
        to underserved communities. They have expanded their program FRESH, which
        is a zoning initiative to bring more affordable, healthy food to communities
        that include Bushwick, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Williamsburg. “Access to
        fresh, healthy food is a priority for me and for this Council, and the
        expansion of the FRESH zoning incentive is a major step forward in our
        fight to ensure all New Yorkers can eat healthy no matter where they live.
        Far too many neighborhoods in our city lack access to affordable,
        healthy food options,” said Speaker Corey Johnson.

        </li>

       <p> Kicker: Even though the city is planning on increasing the amount of
         grocery stores that sell healthy food, organic, natural food is
         much more expensive, which is not accesible for low-income New Yorkers.
